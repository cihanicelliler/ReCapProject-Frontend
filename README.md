# Recap

<h2>
Front-End
</h2>
Angular 11 was used in the front-end part of the project. Throughout the development, Visual Studio Code has been worked on as IDE. Bootstrap has been integrated to achieve a responsive design.
Also used Font-Awesome. BrowserModule, HttpClientModule, AppRoutingModule, FormsModule, ReactiveFormsModule, BrowserAnimationsModule and ToastrModule were used as modules in Angular. 
On the Front-End side, more attention was paid to whether the process is working correctly rather than the design. <br>
<br>

```
WARNING! For Front-End side to work, you need to set WebAPI as "Set as Startup Project" on Back-End side 
and start it with IIS Express. Then you have to follow the steps below.
```
1- First, you need to install the Node modules used in the project. <br>
```
npm install
```
2- Finally, we will open a new terminal and run the project on localhost. <br>
```
ng serve --open
```
